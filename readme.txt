= What does the nofollow attribute do? =
When the search engine spider sees nofollow on the link, it does not follow the link to the new site, not count the link towards it’s popularity score in their ranking engine and not include the link text in the relevancy score for those keywords.

Just check the `rel=\"nofollow\"` option under the default `open link in a new window/tab` option.
